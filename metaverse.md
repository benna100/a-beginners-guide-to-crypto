# The Metaverse

It is nearly impossible to about NFT's without talking about the metaverse. 

It is quite a vague term that people have a hard time defining. But imagine something like the Matrix or the world in Ready Player One or maybe something like Second life. It's an online game world where people can have exactly the avatar they want to represent themselves as. They can have custom clothes, own land online, etc. It will be included in VR, AR. There will be online communities and people can talk to each other online.

There is right now **tons** of hype around this. Can't really tell if it will go like 3d televisions and VR
