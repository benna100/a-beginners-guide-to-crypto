# A beginners guide to crypto



Okay, so where to begin? 

I have always been on the outskirts of crypto. Kind of understanding the basics of what it is about and finding it mildly interesting

But that suddenly changed

One of the people I follow on Twitter (Mikkel Malmberg) suddenly started really diving into crypto

That peaked my curiosity more than it had before

He then got involved in Loot and also made his own NFT called Cranes that got completely sold out

This was the starting point for me to start taking crypto seriously. If someone as smart as Mikkel started taking it serious then there has to be something about it!

So down the rabbithole I went 🐇🕳

And oh boy what a rabbit hole!

Learning about crypto is like arriving at a foreign station in a country who's culture and language you have absolutely no idea about

Hopefully this guide will help clear things up a bit :) 

Let's begin with an overview of what crypto is 👉
