# NFT

NFT stands for non fungible token. It is a way of showing ownership for a digital item. Lets first talk about what a  fungible tokens is:



## Fungible tokens

Fungible tokens are tokens that has the same value. If I have one bitcoin it has the exact same value as one bitcoin someone else owns. That means that dollars are fungible tokens. 1 dollar has the same value as another dollar



## Non fungible tokens

So non fungible are the opposite of fungible tokens. That means that if I have a token it has a different value than some other token. You can see it much like a basketball card. Two different basketball cards have different value. One might be fairly common and one is maybe super rare which gives it more value. 

Okay so two different tokens have different value, so what?



## What are NFT's used for?

The most common use of NFT's is buying digital art. You basically buy a token that proves that you have a receipt for that piece of art. So you don't even own the piece of art, just a receipt proving ! 

So why even bother? It comes back 



The token proves that you own the piece of art and only you can own that piece of art*

## Why are people buying NFT's?

This I have been thinking a lot about really trying to answer the hard way by buying NFT's, selling NFT's, FOMO buying NFT's, thinking about NFT pricing. Here are my preliminary findings (that might be totally wrong)

- Some people really enjoy a piece of work and actually enjoy the thought of being the only person that has a token for that piece of art. There is a direct connection from the artist to the owner (through the token)
- Some people really wants to support digital artists and does that though NFT's
- Some people are in it for the money. Buying a piece of art and then selling it to a higher price
- Some people are not really sure why they bought
- Some people buy out of FOMO. There is this new hot NFT and you can only buy it today
- Some people buy NFT's for the community that is formed with other people owning the same type of NFT. Here are a few examples: https://www.lootproject.com/, https://secretscrollsociety.com/

There are probably 1000 more reasons but I think a combination of actually liking the piece of art (even though you can just download it) but also maybe selling it to a higher price later
